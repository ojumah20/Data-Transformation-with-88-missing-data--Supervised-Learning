# Data-Transformation-with-88-missing-data--Supervised-Learning
Are you dealing with a dataset that has a high number of missing values? In this guide, I'll share five strategies to help you effectively handle such data challenges.

1. Remove Unnecessary Data
Start by removing any data that is not essential to your analysis. This step simplifies the dataset and reduces the burden of missing values.

2. Eliminate Columns with Null Values
Identify columns with all null values or those exceeding 92% missing data. Removing these columns eliminates irrelevant and unreliable information.

3. Address Highly Correlated Columns
Detect and remove highly correlated columns to avoid redundancy and multicollinearity issues. This step streamlines the dataset and improves model performance.

4. Fill Remaining Missing Values
For the remaining missing values, employ appropriate techniques such as imputation or interpolation to fill the gaps. Ensure to choose the most suitable method based on the nature of the data.

5. Feature Importance through Modeling
Utilize modeling techniques to determine the significance of each feature. Train a model and analyze the impact of features on the target variable. This provides insights into the most influential variables.

In this guide https://medium.com/@DataSpace.NG/data-transformation-with-88-missing-data-supervised-learning-12c15bf7bae, I have worked with the Covid-19 dataset available on Kaggle, which presented a significant 88% missing values. It serves as a practical example for data professionals facing similar challenges.
